# Where-Is-My-Father---Unity-Game

**Game title:** Where is my father?


**Game Introduction:**
**1) Game Concept:** The concept is about a man whose father was a steel plant worker. His father disappeared one day when he was young and now (in the game) he revisits his father's old place of work to find out what happened to him. The protagonist Alex Hammond explores the factory along with another character named Dr. Rachel Turner. The player needs to look for clues that may explain what happened around the factory. Moreover, find keys to unlock doors that lead to different areas of the factory. In the end, the player fights the main boss (Forge Warden).
This game concept is chosen to increase the player engagement, where the story revolves around the protagonist. By adding a mystery element to the game, it will enhance the player’s interest to explore the whole game and find out about his father. <br>
Similar to other video games, our title is self-explanatory, telling a bit about goals. The title itself shows the story is going to be emotional. When the game starts there will be enemies but not so strong that the player can’t beat them on the first try, which is true for most of the commercial games as the player needs time to set themselves up in the environment. Additionally, there will be a boss fight at the end, which is going to be more difficult to beat relative to other enemies which aligns with the expectations of the player from this genre’s games. Despite following the same skeleton structure, we have added multiple things which we’ll be discussing in upcoming sections to give players a fresh experience instead of getting bored.

**2) Game atmosphere:** This is a pixel art-based game with a 2D Top Down Perspective. In addition, sound effects are added to the player's attacks or interactions with objects in the game. A soft piano and ambient soundscape are used for the background music to create a sense of melancholy and suspense.

A soft piano and ambient soundscape help the player to experience the intense and dark vibes, where other sound effects like attacks, collecting coins, etc. will give the player instant feedback that action has been executed. Lastly, pixel art-based game with a 2D Top Down Perspective makes the game visually appealing for the players and also computationally efficient for the device it will be played on.

**3) Game theme:** Adventure, Mystery, Industrial.

We chose this theme and concept because it adds an element of suspense to the game and may raise questions such as whether the protagonist will meet his father or not. As discussed in the concept section, it will add a suspense and mystery element to the game, and enhance the player's curiosity and immersion.

**4) Platform and development tools:** Windows, Android, Unity, Blender, Photoshop, Aseprite.
